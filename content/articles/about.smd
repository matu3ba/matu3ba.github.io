### Content
- The purpose of the website is improving the state of the art
with current focus on debugging (not making bugs or removing them).
- Articles are of technical nature with focus of overview and user perspective
and are aimed towards readers with technical background. Articles may be work in process (wip).
- Posts are usually experience reports too short and not in-depth enough for articles.

### Author
- My name is Jan Philipp Hafer and my hobby is system analysis with current
focus on debugging.
- So far I have done various hardware and software things on embedded and desktop
including the full development pipeline.
- One side effect is that I have the habit of asking authors of
projects debugging and design questions, if such information is missing,
and collect best practices and semantics including trade-offs for various systems.
