Especially, when finding out after converting html to markdown for the first level already.</li><li>Dumping properties form scripty instead of having to look them up and having documentation in a more editor-readable way, for example text file, would also have been a nice to have.</li><li>Comments within markdown blocks (empty line, <code>[This is a comment]::</code>) are undocumented and not supported in the editor setup.</li><li>The release process for common platforms should be documented. Github Pages requires <code>Build and deployment Source</code> -> <code>Deploy from branch</code> -> <code>gh-pages</code>, <code>/ (root)</code>.</li></ol><p>All in all, I am happy, but will fix the list issue in SuperMD files, because I believe this nudges people into not writing on edge cases and is a worse experience than plain markdown. Code polishing will also follow.</p></div>
