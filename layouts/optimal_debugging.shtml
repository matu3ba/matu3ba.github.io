                with extensive focus on core components
                (power, battery, periphery, busses, memory/flash and debug/test infrastructure)
                to enable debugging and component tests against product and assembling defects
                are fundamental for software debugging under assumption that computing unit(s)
                and memory unit(s) can be trusted to work reliable enough.
                Depending on goals, time channel analysis, formal methods to rule out logic
                errors and fuzzing against bad temporal behavior (for example during speculative execution)
                are common methods besides various testing strategies based on statistical analysis.

                The managing environment the code is running on can vary a lot.
                As example, the typical four phases of the Linux boot process
                (system startup, bootloader stage, kernel stage, and init process)
                have each their own debugging infrastructure and methods.
                Generally, working with (introspection-restricted) platforms requires
                1. reverse engineering and "trying to find info" and/or 2. "use some tracing
                tool" and for 3. open source "adjust the source and stare at kernel
                dumps/use debugger".
                Kernels are rarely designed for tracing, recording, formal
                verification due to internal complexity and virtualization is slow and
                hides many classes of synchronization bugs.
                Due to being complex, moving targets, having no library design, having design flaws
                and many performance tradeoffs, they are hard to fuzz test.

                Staring at source code, backend intermediate representation like LLVM
                IR and reducing the problem or resulting assembly. Unfortunately the
                backend optimizers like LLVM do not offer frontend language writers
                debug APIs and related tooling due to not being designed for that
                purpose.

                Tools like Miri or Cerberus run the program in an interpreter,
                but may not cover all possible program semantics due to ambiguity
                and may not be feasible, so the only good chance is to reduce it.
