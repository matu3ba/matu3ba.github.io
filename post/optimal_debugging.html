<h2>Towards an optimal debugging framework library.</h2>
</div>
  This text is intended as overview of debugging techniques and motivation for
  uniform execution representation and setup to efficiently mix and match the
  appropriate technique for system level debugging with focus on statically
  optimizing compiler languages to keep complexity and scope limited.
  The author accepts the irony of such statements by "C having no ABI"/many
  systems in practice having no ABI, but reality is in this text simplified for
  brevity and sanity.

      theory;
      A program <a href="https://gu.outerproduct.net/debug.html">
      can be represented as (often non-deterministic) state machine</a>,
      such that a <b>bug</b> is a <b>bad transition rule</b> between those states.
      It is usually assumed that the developer/user knows correct and incorrect
      (bad) system states and the code represents a somewhat correct model of
      the intended semantics.
      Then an execution witness are the states and state transitions encountered
      on a specific program run. If the execution witness shows a "bad state",
      then there must be a bug.
      Thus a <b>debugger</b> can be seen <b>as query engine over states and transitions of
        a buggy execution witness.</b><br>
      Frequent operations are bug source isolation to deterministic components,
      where encapsulation of non-determinism usually simplifies the process.
      In contrast to that, concurrent code is tricky to debug, because one
      needs to trace the execution flow to estimate where the origin of the
      incorrect state is.<br>
      One can generally categorize methods into the following list (<b>asoul</b>)
      <ol>
        <li><b>automate</b> the process to minimize errors/oversights during debugging,
        against probabilistic errors, document the process etc
        </li>
        <li><b>simplify and isolate</b> system components and changes over time</li>
        <li><b>observe</b> the system while running it to <b>trace state or state changes</b></li>
        <li><b>understand</b> the <b>expected and actual code semantics</b> to the degree
        <li><b>learn, extend and ensure</b> how and which system invariants are satisfied</li>
          necessary from <b>of the involved systems</b> (for example userspace
          processes, kernel, build system, compiler, source code, linker,
          object code, assembly, hardware etc)
        </li>
      </ol>
      with the fundamental constrains being (<b>feel</b>)
      <ol>
        <li><b>finding out</b> correct sytem components semantics</li>
        <li><b>[e]ensuring</b> deterministic reproducibility of the problem</li>
        <li><b>limited</b> time and effort</li>
      </ol>

      Common debugging methods to <b>feel a soul</b> with various tradeoffs
      from compile-time to runtime debugging less to more run-time data
      collection:
      <ol>
        <li> <b>Formal Verification</b> as ahead or compile-time invariant resolving.</li>
        <li> <b>Validation</b> as runtime invariant checks.</li>
        <li> <b>Testing</b> as sample based runtime invariant checks.</li>
        <li> <b>Stepping</b> via "classical debugger" to manipulate task execution
          context, manipulate memory optionally via source code location translation
          via REPL commands, graphically, scripting or (rarely) freely programmable.</li>
        <li> <b>Logging</b> as dumping (a simplification of) state with context
          from bugs (usually timestamps in production systems).</li>
        <li> <b>Tracing</b> as dumping (a simplification of) runtime behavior
          via temporal relations (usually timestamps).</li>
        <li> <b>Recording</b> Encoded dumping of runtime to replay runtime with
          before specified time and state determinism.</li>
      </ol>

      Simplification and isolation means to apply the meaning of both words on
      all potential sub-components including, but not limited to
      hardware, code versioning including dependencies, source system,
      compiler framework and target system. Typical methods are
      <ol>
        <li> <b>Bisection</b> via git or the actual binaries.</li>
        <li> <b>Reduction</b> via removal of system parts or trying to reproduce
          with (a minimal) example.</li>
        <li> <b>Statistical analysis</b> from collected data on how the problem
          manifests on given environment(s) etc.</li>
      </ol>

      <b>Debugging</b> is domain- and design-specific and <b>relies on</b> core component(s)
      of <b>the to be debugged system to provide necessary debug functionality</b>.
      For example, hardware debugging relies on interfaces to the hardware like
      JTAG, Kernel debugging on Kernel compilation or configuration and
      elevated (user), userspace debugging on process and user permissions,
      system configuration or a child process to be debugged on Posix systems
      via ptrace.

    <li><a href="#practice">Practical methods with tradeoffs.</a></li>
    Usually semantics are not "set into stone" inclusive or do not offer
    sufficient tradeoffs, so formal verification are no option aside of usage
    of models as design and planning tool.

    TODO: requirements on system design for formal verification vs debugging.
    no surprise rule: core system enabling debugging (in any form) must be correct
    to the degree necessary.

      <ol>
        <li>Hard(ware) problems</li>
        Component tests against defects, Time channels.

        <li>Kernel problems</li>
        Reverse engineering and "trying to find info" or "use some tracing
        tool" and for open source "adjust the source and stare at kernel
        dumps/use debugger".
        <li>Detectable Undefined Behavior</li>
        Compiler and runtime sanitizers like TODO list.
        <li>Undetectable Undefined Behavior</li>
        Staring at source code, backend intermediate representation like LLVM
        IR and reducing the problem or resulting assembly. Unfortunately the
        backend optimizers like LLVM do not offer frontend language writers
        debug APIs and related tooling due to not being designed for that
        purpose.
        <li>Miscompilations</li>
        Tools like Miri or Cerberus run the program in an interpreter,
        but may not cover all possible program semantics due to ambiguity
        and may not be feasible, so the only good chance is to reduce it.

      Overall, one can summarize that it is <b>good practice to have</b> a
      <b>system correctness and debugging strategy</b>.

      <!-- <li>Verification</li> -->
    <li><a href="#uniform_execution_representation">Uniform execution representation.</a></li>
      As it was shown before, modern languages simplify detection or elimination of
      memory problems and runtime detectable undefined behavior.
      So far undetectable undefined behavior may be detected, if backend optimizers
      are redesignede with according APIs.
      Detecting miscompilations requires strict formal reasoning of executing
      the source code semantics or formal verification of the compiler
      itself, which shall not be discussed here.
      This leaves hardware problems, kernel problems, resource leaks, freezes,
      performance problems and logic problems.
