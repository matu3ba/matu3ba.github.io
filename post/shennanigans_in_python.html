<h2>Shennanigans in Python</h2>
</div>
<div id="contents">
  Python on itself is great for prototyping up to a few hundred lines of code,
  like to preprocess some C code.<br>
  However, it is unfeasible to scale, for example library code.
  Changes in a leaf function can add exceptions to higher level code paths and
  handling those via exceptions for user friendly error messages, for example
  to collect context (information along multiple functions) becomes
  unreasonably verbose and error prone.<br>
  The alternative is to use C-like error handling, which requires to figure out
  all possible exceptions of Python libstd methods, which language servers
  do not support (as of 20240404).<br>
  These list of shennanigans was created during my work to create a system
  integration library and framework for hardware and software including
  developer tasks like worktree management, building, target deployment and
  configuration. Therefore it should be representative for hacky things
  one might want to do in absence of better tooling.

# readline() with timeout io file api is broken, see https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/51571
# Workaround
# * 1. Read from Kernel structure and append chunk-wise to buffer from socket until stop event.
# * 2. After each read, try line = readline() from the buffer and remove the line on success.
# * 3. On failure of reading line, continue with 1.
# * 4. Teardown should also use readSocket to read all Kernel memory, if a stop was signaled.
# Note: utf-8 decoding must also be done and select or an equivalent should be used to check,
# if data for reading exists.

# SHENNANIGAN Generic module annotation not allowed

#     if str(type(module)) != "<class 'module'>": return 1

# SHENNANIGAN
# No explicit scheduling methods + watchdogs. Unlucky schedules may cause fatal
# delay for shuffling data between daemon thread and main thread.
# As example: 1 main thread, 2 deamon threads may cause the relevant deamon thread
# not being scheduled for 2 seconds. Empirically 3 seconds work.
# In other words: Python thread scheduling is extremely unreliable.

# Must not use trailing comma in dictionary or json.dumps generated string has
